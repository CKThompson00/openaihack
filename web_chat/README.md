### Web Chat

To enable a web chat using Azure Cognitive Search, you simply need to follow these steps:

1. Implement this repo: https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo.
2. Rather than using PDF or other documents, you will implement a screen scrapping tool to ingest into Azure Cognitive Search
3. screen_scrape.py is an example script you can use to scape and push content to the index
